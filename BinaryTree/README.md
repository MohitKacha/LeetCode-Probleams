# Validate-Binary-Search-Tree-LeetCode
 BinarySearchTree.java => https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/

Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

# Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

InorderTraverse.java => https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/

- Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

# Range Sum of BST

RangeSumOfBST.java => https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-of-bst/

- Given the root node of a binary search tree, return the sum of values of all nodes with value between L and R (inclusive)
